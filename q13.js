// 13.Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var list = ["supercar", "Car", "Motorcycle", "superBike", "yatch"];
console.log("I would like to own a Devel sixteen ".concat(list[0], "."));
console.log("I would like to own a toyota crown R5 ".concat(list[1], "."));
console.log("I would like to own a suzuki inazuma ".concat(list[2], "."));
console.log("I would like to own a Kawasaki ninja H2r ".concat(list[3], "."));
console.log("I would like to own a Aurora ".concat(list[4], "."));
