// 13.Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
let list = ["supercar", "Car", "Motorcycle", "superBike", "yatch"];
console.log(`I would like to own a Devel sixteen ${list[0]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a toyota crown R5 ${list[1]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a suzuki inazuma ${list[2]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a Kawasaki ninja H2r ${list[3]}.`);
console.log(`I would like to own a Aurora ${list[4]}.`);
