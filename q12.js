// 12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Ahmed", "zaid", "a.basit", "saad"];
console.log("hello ".concat(names[0], ", how are you doing today?"));
console.log("hello ".concat(names[1], ", how are you doing today?"));
console.log("hello ".concat(names[2], ", how are you doing today?"));
console.log("hello ".concat(names[3], ", how are you doing today?"));
