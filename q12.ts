// 12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ["Ahmed", "zaid", "a.basit", "saad"];
console.log(`hello ${names[0]}, how are you doing today?`);
console.log(`hello ${names[1]}, how are you doing today?`);
console.log(`hello ${names[2]}, how are you doing today?`);
console.log(`hello ${names[3]}, how are you doing today?`);
